%we divided our work into three sections
%the first section was coded by Maria Iorini and debugged by Melissa Aldana and Jack Holmes
%the estimated time to code was around 15 hours, 5 hours for planning and research and 5 hours for debugging 
%extra hours were added for TA hours and class time

%in this first section we are storing question in containers.map so that we can retrieve parts of the question later
%the questions tests to see which traits the quiz taker possesses and relates it to each flavor
